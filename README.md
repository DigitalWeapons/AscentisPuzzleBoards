# AscentisPuzzleBoards
Hi all,

My first attempt at Angular :) Some notes:

* The file pb.png is a pixel in size and uses 'background-size':'cover'

* I have built for loading the yPos through JSON for PuzzleBoard 2 at 800 as requested, however this has resulted in a stretched board. I am not sure if my output was what you may have had in mind, but I have chose to leave as is for consistency.
