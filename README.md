# AscentisPuzzleBoards
Hi all,

My first attempt at Angular :) Some notes:

* The file pb.png is a pixel in size and uses 'background-size':'cover'

* I have used @Angular/Material which would need to be installed to demonstrate. I already agreed wtih Material design principles before I applied its use.

* I have built for loading the 'yPos' parameter through JSON for PuzzleBoard 2 at 800 as requested, however this has resulted in a stretched board. I am not sure if my output was what you may have had in mind, but I have chose to leave as is for consistency.

* I am fully aware this architecture may not be as expected for component based nature of Angular. I have used an interface based structure which came naturally and am aware that I have much yet to learn.
